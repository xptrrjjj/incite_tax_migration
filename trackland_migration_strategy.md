# Trackland Document Manager Migration Strategy

## 🎯 **Current Setup Understanding**

**You have the "TL - Document Manager" package by Trackland installed, which provides:**
- PDF viewer with annotation capabilities
- Custom objects (DocListEntry__c, etc.)
- S3 file storage integration
- Folder/organization structure
- Document management workflow

## 🔄 **Migration Strategy Options**

### **Option 1: Keep Trackland Package + Migrate Files** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
**What happens:**
- Keep the Trackland package installed (PDF viewer keeps working)
- Migrate files from trackland-doc-storage → your S3 bucket
- Update DocListEntry__c.Document__c URLs to point to your S3
- **Result:** Same UI, same functionality, but files stored in your S3

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero disruption to users
- ✅ PDF viewer/annotator keeps working exactly the same
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ You own the files

**Cons:**
- ❌ Still dependent on Trackland package
- ❌ Package updates could potentially break things

### **Option 2: Replace Trackland Package** 
**What happens:**
- Uninstall Trackland package
- Build custom document management solution
- Migrate files to your S3
- Rebuild PDF viewer functionality

**Pros:**
- ✅ Complete independence from Trackland
- ✅ Full control over functionality

**Cons:**
- ❌ Massive development effort
- ❌ Users lose familiar interface
- ❌ Need to rebuild annotation functionality
- ❌ High risk of data loss/corruption

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
**What happens:**
- Keep Trackland package temporarily
- Migrate files to your S3
- Gradually build replacement functionality
- Phase out Trackland package over time

## 🚀 **Recommended Migration Plan**

### **Phase 1: File Migration (Current)**
1. ✅ **Migration script working** (our existing script)
2. ✅ **Files transfer:** trackland-doc-storage → incite-tax S3
3. ✅ **URL updates:** DocListEntry__c.Document__c points to your S3
4. ✅ **Preserve structure:** Exact same folder hierarchy
5. ✅ **Zero user impact:** PDF viewer works exactly the same

### **Phase 2: Monitoring & Validation**
1. **Test thoroughly** with multiple accounts
2. **Verify PDF viewer** still works with new URLs
3. **Check annotation functionality** 
4. **Monitor performance**
5. **Backup everything** before full migration

### **Phase 3: Full Migration**
1. **Run migration** across all accounts
2. **Monitor for issues**
3. **Provide user support**

## 📊 **Technical Details**

### **What Changes:**
- File URLs: `https://trackland-doc-storage.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/...` 
- Becomes: `https://incite-tax.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/...`

### **What Stays the Same:**
- ✅ PDF viewer interface
- ✅ Annotation functionality  
- ✅ Folder structure
- ✅ Document metadata
- ✅ User experience
- ✅ All Salesforce workflows

### **Package Components We're Using:**
- **DocListEntry__c** - Document records
- **Folder__c** - Folder structure
- **PDF Viewer Component** - View/annotate PDFs
- **S3 Integration** - File storage handling

## 🔧 **Migration Script Adjustments**

Our current script is already perfect for this! It:
- ✅ Queries DocListEntry__c records
- ✅ Downloads from trackland-doc-storage
- ✅ Uploads to your S3 bucket
- ✅ Updates Document__c URLs
- ✅ Preserves folder structure

## ⚠️ **Important Considerations**

### **1. Package License/Terms**
- Check if Trackland charges per file or storage
- Verify if migrating files violates terms
- Consider reaching out to Trackland about your migration

### **2. Backup Strategy**
- **CRITICAL:** Full backup before migration
- Test with single account first
- Have rollback plan ready

### **3. User Communication**
- Files will work exactly the same
- No training needed
- Might be slightly faster (your S3 vs theirs)

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Run current migration** on test account
2. **Verify PDF viewer** works with new URLs
3. **Test annotation functionality**
4. **Check performance**
5. **Proceed with full migration**

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Test annotations:** Make sure users can still annotate PDFs
- **Check permissions:** Ensure S3 bucket permissions are correct
- **Monitor costs:** Your S3 costs vs Trackland costs
- **Performance:** Your S3 region vs user locations
